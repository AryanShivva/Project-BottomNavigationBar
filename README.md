WORKING WITH THE FRAGMENTS AND BOTTOM NAVIGATIONBAR


Fragment

In Android, the fragment is the part of Activity which represents a portion of User Interface(UI) on the screen. It is the modular section of the android activity that is very helpful in creating UI designs that are flexible in nature and auto-adjustable based on the device screen size. The UI flexibility on all devices improves the user experience and adaptability of the application. Fragments can exist only inside an activity as its lifecycle is dependent on the lifecycle of host activity. For example, if the host activity is paused, then all the methods and operations of the fragment related to that activity will stop functioning, thus fragment is also termed as sub-activity. Fragments can be added, removed, or replaced dynamically i.e., while activity is running. 

Types of Android Fragments

Single Fragment: Display only one single view on the device screen. This type of fragment is mostly used for mobile phones.

List Fragment: This Fragment is used to display a list-view from which the user can select the desired sub-activity. The menu drawer of apps like Gmail is the best example of this kind of fragment.

Fragment Transaction: This kind of fragments supports the transition from one fragment to another at run time. Users can switch between multiple fragments like switching tabs
